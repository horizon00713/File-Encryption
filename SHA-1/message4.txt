This study introduces a novel approach to image classification by integrating fine-grained noisy label learning using multi-modal pre-trained model prompt learning. Furthermore, the framework enhances robustness through noisy label learning using transition matrix classifier consistency, establishing a highly reliable system for handling label ambiguity in complex visual datasets.
